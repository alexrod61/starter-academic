I'm an instructor in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. I have worked in diverse fields throughout my academic and professional trajectory, such as credit risk management, consulting, Data Science, and statistical teaching. I have a background in Industrial Engineering, and Applied Statistics with research related to machine learning. 

My research is focused on computer experiments that emulate scientific and engineering systems with Gaussian stochastic processes. I've developed modelling reformulations that seek to improve output prediction accuracy while relying on dimensional analysis and statistical principles from the first half of the 20th century. I'm incredibly passionate about teaching statistical topics in a Data Science context while approaching real-life data-related projects for social good.
