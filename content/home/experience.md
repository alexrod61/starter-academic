        + Research-related activities as part of the doctoral dissertation in computer experiments, which was focused on the prediction accuracy impact with a reformulation in the data correlation structures of a Gaussian Stochastic Process along with dimensional analysis. This reformulations rely on certain effect principles, which have been used in physical factorial experiments, as well mathematical theorems applied to dimensional analysis coming from the early beginnings of the 20th century.
        + Teaching-related activities include grading exams and/or projects, practicum design, and holding laboratories/office hours for the following undergraduate courses on a term-to-term basis:
          -  STAT 200: Elementary Statistics for Applications in Science (second-year level).
          -  STAT 251: Elementary Statistics for Engineering (second-year level).
          -  STAT 305: Introduction to Statistical Inference (third-year level).
          -  STAT 404: Design and Analysis of Experiments (fourth-year level).
